We'll have a landing page here soon to inform users:
- Why they are seeing this page (they don't have a wallet app installed that supports the Mobile Wallet Adapter protocol)
- What they'll be able to do after installing a MWA-compatible wallet
- Which MWA-compatible wallets are available for their device, and how to get one

In the meantime, you can bask in the awesomeness of being one of the first to use a MWA-compatible dApp!
